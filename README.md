# Data-Warehousing-and-Data-Mining-
This project involves creating SSIS ETL packages in visual studio for extracting UK Accidents data from various sources.  Designing data warehouse fact and dimension tables using star schema.  Then doing aggregations on the cubes created. We queried data warehouse using MDX queries to answer specific analytical questions. We created machine learning model in SSAS and choose a model with best accuracy in predicting accident severity.
